					I am a Utah born and raised native, but this picture is from when I lived in New Zealand and where my heart will always be. It is there that I fell in love with a good sunset on a cloudy day, and gained a great appreciation for many of the polonesian cultures. I returned to utah after 2 years of living with the Kiwi people in Nov of 2015 and have been trying to get back ever since!
					<br><br>
					Since being home I have been working for a company called Command7. I started there as a data entry clerk, and was lucky enough to have some slow days and a very patient co-worker to teach me how to use Excel and, more importantly, how to write <u>V</u>isual <u>B</u>asic for <u>A</u>pplications (VBA). From there I have gained a great deal of experience with coding theology. I am still with the same company today and currently am an accountant and VBA programmer creating financial reporting programs and interactive excel spreadsheets.
